# DND-BattleMat
@author A Lonely DM who wants to be a player
Creating a DND Battle Mat simulator that will generate enemies and place them on a grid.
The enemies will react and have diffrent personalities that will affect how they act in combat.
Its no fun if they don't act like actual living things
